                Katie has always had a passion for helping people reach their highest potential.
                A degree in International Relations led her to live around the world; from China
                to Peru, Australia to India, places that inspired her to constantly challenge herself
                for growth. Through the journeys, Katie realized her true &quot;yoga&quot; was believing
                in others&#39; growth with the same passion and intensity she was experiencing her
                own inner development. Once back in San Diego, as traveling had been her vehicle
                for self progress, her yoga mat became the magic carpet to discover new adventure.
                Power 200 Hour Teacher Training started her off, and continued into Yoga Sculpt,
                Yoga Pilates, Hot Power Fusion, High Energy, Kids Yoga, and now working through
                Ayurvedic certifications towards her RYT500, including study in India. Guiding yoga
                classes has become the true vehicle for not just her own expansion and inner drive,
                but it allows Katie, everyday, to help students awaken to their happiest and strongest
                self... that has been there all along.</p>
